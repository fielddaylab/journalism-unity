One week later.
The Smoke City Herald is still waiting for you to drive out for an interview...
But you've been too busy to call them back. 
Here at the Twin Lakes Emergency Meeting, the mood is decidedly anxious.  
{@person} Welp, we'd better get right down to it.
{@person} More rain is expected to hit in 3 days, and Twin Lakes still isn't lookin' its best. 
{@person} Some of you folks are gonna need to evacuate.
{@phone} What??? Where will we go?
{@phone} This is my home. I'm not leaving!
{@phone} I don't want random evacuees camped out in my neighborhood!
{@person}  Aw, cheer up, folks. We'll get through this together. We're #TwinLakesStrong! 
{@person}  My emergency response team is settin' up a shelter at the high school!
{@person}  It's a great shelter. Real cozy. You'll love it. 
{@phone}  What if the dam bursts??
{@person}  Aw, Finkler, quit panicking folks. The dam won't burst.
{@person}  ...Probably.

{@me} And, um... about that letter of recommendation I asked you for....
{@person} Don't worry, kid. I'm working on it.
{@me} But... I mean, with all that's going on, I understand if you're too busy--

{@me} I'm really sorry to bother you, Ms. Rhodes. I'm writing a story about accessibility at the shelter.

{@me} One of my best friends from college uses a wheelchair! 
Instantly, you wish you could take it back. Too late. 
The woman is silent for a moment. Then... 
{@summer} Sorry. I'd love to be your token disabled voice, but I need to go watch paint dry.

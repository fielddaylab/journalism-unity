"It's the only way to keep up with bills. But that means the damage in the basement has gotten worse. It's a mess down there. I'm worried about mold. I want to keep my kids healthy, but we also have to make our mortgage payments."

You laugh. "Maybe someday, when there's not a huge storm headed our way."

Already, the sky is cloudy and darkening. 

[[Knock at the first door.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="605" name="Knock at the first door." tags="" position="15958,1561" size="100,100">The door swings open, revealing an elderly man with a walker. Behind him, the dad and teenage boy from earlier are carrying a trombone case and a piano keyboard up from the basement. 

"How can I help you?" the man says politely, looking from you to Khalisa.

"We're from the Gazette," Khalisa says. "This is my friend, Ella Rookie. She's new around here. Can we talk with you for a few minutes?"

"I suppose so. How can I help you two?"

[[Ask the elderly man what would help him prepare for the next storm.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="606" name="Ask the elderly man what would help him prepare for the next storm." tags="" position="15958,1699" size="100,100">"My neighbors already got it covered," he says, pointing to the father-son duo walking past. "They've been clearing out the basement. I've played in a lot of bands over the years, and fortunately most of my instruments could be salvaged. I just hope this place doesn't flood again."

"And older folks, like me. We could use more helpers out here. My neighbors here can't do everything on their own."

"Sure we can, Dez," the dad says, grinning. "Don't worry. Just go put your feet up."

[[Thank Dezi for his help and head back outside.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="608" name="Thank Dezi for his help and head back outside." tags="" position="16103,1562" size="100,100">You knock at the next house, a red-brick bungalow.

You see the curtains rustle. Then a woman opens the door, a little girl hugging her legs.

"Khalisa," she says, "my God, is that you? And who's your friend? Come on in!"

[[Receive a warm welcome--and a slice of cake.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="609" name="Receive a warm welcome--and a slice of cake." tags="" position="16230,1562" size="100,100">You find yourself feeling extremely glad that you called Khalisa. Turns out the woman, Misty, used to volunteer at the cherry festival with Khalisa's mom.

You end up at the table with her three kids--plus a glass of milk and a slice of cherry cheesecake. 

"We're clearing out the fridge," the woman explains. "Lost power last time--don't want to risk losing a buch of food again. What can I do for you two?"

[[Tell her about the story you're writing.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="610" name="Tell her about the story you&#39;re writing." tags="" position="16228,1712" size="100,100">"I'm writing a story about how the city can help people before the next flood hits," you say. "Can you tell us about the situation in your neighborhood?" 

"It's been a disaster," she says. "That mess in the street is gonna block the storm drains. Nobody has had time to recover from last time. And with all the attention on downtown, it feels like nobody has really noticed."

[["What would be the most helpful for you?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="611" name="&quot;What would be the most helpful for you?&quot;" tags="" position="16227,1856" size="100,100">"Honestly?" she says. "Money. Disaster aid, I mean. I can't get enough time off work to deal with the damaage, and I don't have thousands of dollars laying around for repairs. But I know that's not gonna happen. I'd settle with being on the city's radar. We need sandbags here in the neighborhood. And some volunteers to help stack them up for families and elderly folks."

"I trust you, Honey. Especially if you're with Khalisa. Glad you both found somebody special." 

"Oh--um, we're not--I mean, I don't think--" 

You trail off, not sure what to say, and Khalisa laughs.

"How about thoe photos, Rookie?"

But when you reach the lakeshore, you don't see any blue houses--only Nora's Arc, bobbing a few meters off shore.

"Hello there, Dear!" she calls from across the water, sipping tea from an enormous cat-shaped mug. "Come back to talk?"

When you reach the river, you don't see any blue houses--only the houseboat lady's blue-painted boat, bobbing on the river.

"Hello there, Dear!" she calls from across the water, a cat resting on her arm. "Come back to talk?"

"Read this. I offered to help people with the process, but no one was interested. People don't usually listen to me. Not like you, though, Dear. You've been kind to me from day one."

"Um..." You're definitely feeling more than a little awkward. "Thank you so much, Nora. I appreciate your help."

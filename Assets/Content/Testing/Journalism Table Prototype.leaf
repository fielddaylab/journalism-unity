One week later...

Twin Lakes is still working to recover before more rain hits.

Downtown streets are blocked off with barricades, while people in flood zones frantically sandbag their properties. 

It's not enough. One rainy day could plunge everything back into chaos.

The mayor has called an emergency Town Meeting. Judging by the excitement in the air, this is sort of a big deal. 

You have time to do one thing before the gathering starts.

Thankfully, your editor has saved you a seat.

"This is crazy," you say. "The whole town must be here!"

* In-depth background on the situation
* Different perspectives from experts and ordinary townspeople
* Quotes and photos for color

This guy might not be too happy with you, but Sophia seems grateful you spoke up. She refills the customer's coffee.

"Feel free to take your coffee to go, if the sandbags are too much of an eyesore," she tells him. "There's some scenic flooding along Black Cherry Park you might enjoy."

You're astonished. Seems that Sophia can dish out more than fritatta.

The mayor stands up front, wearing a cherry-embroidered hat that looks vaguely familiar.

He explains that the dam is at capacity, with water lapping over the top. The county is slowly letting out water, which will cause more flooding, because the alternative would be letting the dam burst--a far greater disaster.

"I know everybody wants this to be over," he says. "But until we get the lakes back down, Twin Lakes will be on high alert. There is a chance that whole neighborhoods will need to be evacuated."

He talks about the importance of sandbagging, checking flood maps, and 

Then he opens the floor for questions.

You walk between two red-brick, A-frame houses and find your way to the lakeshore.

You're surprised to see that the damage isn't bad here--the docks are covered in water, but the houses are built on high ground. The flood hasn't touched them. A pontoon boat is bobbing on the water, full of people fishing and sipping drinks.

Down the lakeshore, you can see a scenic view of downtown--complete with barricades and debris.

The nurse gratefully accepts. She's had enough of lugging sandbags on and off the bus.


$if Stat(Endurance) >6
You help her load as many sandbag as you can fit into your trunk. 

She thanks you, but it's still clearly not enough to protect an entire household. One person isn't going to be able to solve this. It'll take government action to help.
$else
You try to help her load up sandbags, but somehow they feel even heavier than last time.

She smiles at your sheepish expression. "It's okay, Honey. I'm turning patients and doing hoyer lifts five days a week. I'm sure you've got plenty of other skills."

You want to ask him about people who--just for example--are required to be at work and can't stay off the roads. Or bring up the fact that the Royal Hazel neighborhood doesnt currently have a sandbag station.

You help the nurse unload her sandbag, then take a look around. 

Compared to your own neighborhood, which has mostly recovered, Royal Hazel is looking rough around the edges. The tree branches and debris piled along the sidewalks still haven't been picked up by the city. 

A dad and a teenage boy are lugging damaged furniture and rolled-up carpets to the curb, while a few people stack sandbags in front of their house. 

Everyone here (except for you) is Black and glancing at you with confusion, like maybe you've wandered into the wrong neighborhood, or are about to start handing out pamphlets. You have a feeling whatever trust points you've gained won't translate the same way here.

At the fourth house, a elementary-age girl opens the door. "Hi," she says. "Who're you?"

The her mom comes over, wearing rubber gloves and a dust mask. "Sorry," she says. "Whatver you're selling, it's not a good time. We're in damage control mode here."

Ouch.  

"Um... yeah, you're right," you say, wishing Fred Finkler was around to offer some locally-grown aloe vera for that burn. "We should've come out here sooner."

"I understand there's been a lot going on," the woman says. "But you might've noticed that there's been a lot of attention on downtown. Businesses, shops, the festival, things like that. Nobody was really taking notice of what was going on out here."
